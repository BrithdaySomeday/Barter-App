# Barter App
### React-Native App

In the age of the internet, everyone is connected and it is easy to share information
with everyone. What if we could share our physical belongings just as easily as we
share information.

This app called the 'Barter App' helps people exchange items such as books, toys, electronic gadgets, stationery etc.
When you request an item, you will have to state the reason for your request.

You will be allowed **Only One Request** at a time.  

This app is currently **under progress**


Once I'm done with this app, I will not be publishing it on Google Play Store but instead it'll remain here in this repository.
